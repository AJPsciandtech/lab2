# My Reflection / Blog
Github is a  very useful and unique tool for programmers.  Through Github programmers can collaborate on a project while maintaining organization.  After programmers finish making their final edits or commits, they can send a pull request.  A pull request is a submission of your final commit to be reviewed by the project coordinator.  This process creates an organized way to approve or deny the edits within the team of programmers.  

Additionally, I would like to include that Github is a great tool for a team of programmers.  I have never heard of this application before, so there was a bit of a learning curve in order to understand Github.  However, I discovered shortly after that Github was somewhat easy to use in regards to the function that we used such as commits and pull requests.  I look forward to learning more about Github as well as using it in the future.
